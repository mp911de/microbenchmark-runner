Microbenchmark Runner
=====================

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/mp911de/microbenchmark-runner.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#mp911de/microbenchmark-runner) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mp911de/microbenchmark-runner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mp911de/microbenchmark-runner)

Microbenchmark Runner is a JUnit (JUnit 4.12/JUnit 5.3) extension to run JMH benchmarks using JUnit directly by using existing JUnit integrations.

Typically, JMH benchmarks are launched using the JMH runner or a tool chain plugin such as Maven or Gradle. This is the ideal approach for JMH benchmark automation. The missing bit in JMH tooling is proper IDE support to selectively run JMH benchmarks when working on benchmarks.

Here is a quick teaser of a what Microbenchmark Runner can do for you:

### JUnit 4.x

```java
@RunWith(Microbenchmark.class)
public class SimpleBenchmark {

    @State
    static class MyParameters {

        @Param({"1", "10", "100"}) // renders parametrized benchmarks as sub-tests
        String batchSize;
    }
    
    @Benchmark
    public void foo(MyParameters myParameters) {}
}
```

Decorate your JMH benchmark with `@RunWith(Microbenchmark.class)`. Now you're able to leverage your IDE to start JMH benchmarks without fighting the command line. 

### JUnit 5.3.x

```java
@Microbenchmark
public class SimpleBenchmark {

    @State
    static class MyParameters {

        @Param({"1", "10", "100"})  // renders parametrized benchmarks as sub-tests
        String batchSize;
    }
    
    @Benchmark
    public void foo(MyParameters myParameters) {}
}
```

Decorate your JMH benchmark with `@Microbenchmark`. Now you're able to leverage your IDE to start JMH benchmarks without fighting the command line. Adding `@Testable` to benchmark methods allows direct entry points to methods without the need to run the benchmark first.

# Integrate it in your project

The easiest way is to use [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io/#mp911de/microbenchmark-runner/master) to include Microbenchmark Runner in your project:

Add the following repository to your `pom.xml` (when using Maven):

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

and one of the dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.mp911de.microbenchmark-runner</groupId>
    <artifactId>microbenchmark-runner-junit4</artifactId>
    <version>${version}.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.mp911de.microbenchmark-runner</groupId>
    <artifactId>microbenchmark-runner-junit5</artifactId>
    <version>${version}.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

# Configuration

You can configure the runner by using System Properties and Environment Variables to control behavior of the following parameters:

* `benchmarksEnabled` (`boolean`, defaults to `true`) Controls whether benchmarks should be executed. Setting `benchmarksEnabled=false` can be useful for conditional execution of benchmarks.
* `benchmarkReportDir` (`File`, defaults to `none`) Writes JMH benchmark results to this directory.
* `warmupIterations` (`integer`, defaults to `-1`) Global override of warmup iterations. Uses `@Warmup` or JMH defaults if set to `-1`
* `warmupTime` (`integer`, defaults to `-1`) Global override of warmup time. Uses `@Warmup` or JMH defaults if set to `-1`. 
* `measurementIterations` (`integer`, defaults to `-1`) Global override of measurement iterations. Uses `@Measurement` or JMH defaults if set to `-1`. 
* `measurementTime` (`integer`, defaults to `-1`) Global override of measurement time. Uses `@Measurement` or JMH defaults if set to `-1`. 
* `forks` (`integer`, defaults to `-1`) Global override of number of forks. Uses `@Fork` or JMH defaults if set to `-1`.

# Limitations

Microbenchmark Runner uses JUnit infrastructure to select Benchmarks to run and JUnit's progress reporting. Benchmarks are delegated to JMH's Runner Engine for execution. In consequence, JUnit annotations such as `@Before`, `@BeforeEach`, `@BeforeAll`, and others do not have any effect as they are not considered by the execution engine.  

# Reporting Issues

Microbenchmark Runner uses GitHub’s integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the issue tracker to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn’t already exist, create a new issue.
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Microbenchmark Runner that you are using, as well as your Operating System and JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use Markdown \`\`\` escapes before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. 

# Building from Source

If you want to try out the latest and greatest, Microbenchmark Runner can be easily built with the [maven wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper). You also need JDK 1.8.

```
$ ./mvnw clean install
```
